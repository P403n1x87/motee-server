# Motee

Remote for your Linux HTPC.


## Synopsis

Motee allows you to control your Linux HTPC box remotely using, e.g., an
Android smart phone. It gives you control over the currently running
applications by querying the X server, the MPRIS players over DBus, mouse and
keyboard


## Roadmap

The current design is still in a PoC state. The current synchronous processing
of messages should be changed with asynchronous processing for better
responsiveness and performance for the clients.
